I anticipate many cool third party usages including mobile notifications for users interacting with a Minecraft server in various ways. One cool example of this is a 'Ding' doorbell where users could essentially have a doorbell on their home in minecraft to get alerts when other users walk past or ring the doorbell. Other use cases include more generic meta data (user joins a server, disconnects, etc) - I can see these being really useful for omitting and posting to Discord servers, potentially to even build a connection between Discord messages and in game minecraft messages.",
